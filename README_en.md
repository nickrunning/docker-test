Docker-based WeChat Linux client with browser access support using Selkies WebRTC technology.

## Project Overview

This project packages the official WeChat Linux client in a Docker container, enabling direct WeChat usage in browsers through Selkies technology without local installation. Suitable for server deployment, remote work, and other scenarios.

## Upgrade Notes

> If some features are missing after an upgrade, please clear the `openbox` directory in the local mounted directory (e.g., `./config/.config/openbox`).

## Features

- 🌐 **Browser Access**: Use WeChat directly through web browsers without local installation
- 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: Simple containerized deployment with environment isolation
- 🔒 **Data Persistence**: Supports persistent storage of configurations and chat records
- 🎨 **Chinese Support**: Complete Chinese fonts and localization support, including local Chinese input methods
- 🖼️ **Image Copy**: Support image copying through sidebar panel
- 📁 **File Transfer**: Support file transfer through sidebar panel
- 🖥️ **AMD64 and ARM64 Architecture Support**: Compatible with mainstream CPU architectures
- 🔧 **Hardware Acceleration**: Optional GPU hardware acceleration support
- 🪟 **Window Switcher**: Added a floating window switcher in the top left corner for easy switching to background windows, laying the foundation for adding other features in the future

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Modern browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Quick Deployment

1. **Direct deployment using pre-built images**
GitHub Container Registry image:
```bash
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 -v ./config:/config ghcr.io/nickrunning/wechat-selkies:latest
```
Docker Hub image:
```bash
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 -v ./config:/config nickrunning/wechat-selkies:latest
```

2. **Access WeChat**
   
   Open in browser: `https://localhost:3001` or `https://<server-ip>:3001`

### Custom Deployment (Source Code Deployment)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nickrunning/wechat-selkies.git
   cd wechat-selkies
   ```

2. **Start the service**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access WeChat**

   Open in browser: `https://localhost:3001` or `https://<server-ip>:3001`

### Configuration

For more custom configurations, please refer to [Selkies Base Images from LinuxServer](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-selkies).

#### Docker Hub Push Configuration
This project supports pushing to both GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub. Docker Hub push is optional and requires manual configuration. Please add the following Environment Secrets and Environment Variables in your repository to enable Docker Hub push functionality:

**Required Environment Secrets:**
* `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
* `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub Access Token

**Required Environment Variables:**
* `ENABLE_DOCKERHUB`: Set to `true` to enable Docker Hub push

#### Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TITLE` | `WeChat Selkies` | Web UI title |
| `PUID` | `1000` | User ID |
| `PGID` | `100` | Group ID |
| `TZ` | `Asia/Shanghai` | Timezone setting |
| `LC_ALL` | `zh_CN.UTF-8` | Locale setting |
| `CUSTOM_USER` | - | Custom username (recommended) |
| `PASSWORD` | - | Web UI access password (recommended) |

#### Port Configuration

- `3001`: Web UI access port

#### Volume Mounts

- `./config:/config`: WeChat configuration and data persistence directory

> **Note:** If the right-click menu lacks `WeChat` related options after an upgrade, please clear the `openbox` directory in the local mounted directory (e.g., `./config/.config/openbox`).

## Advanced Configuration

### Hardware Acceleration

If your system supports GPU hardware acceleration, the Docker Compose configuration includes relevant device mapping:

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
```
